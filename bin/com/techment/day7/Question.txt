Q.1) can you call the base 
Q.1 Can you call the base class method without creating an instance?				
ans : Yes, you can call the base class without instantiating it if:
It is a static method
The base class is inherited by some other subclass

Q.2) What is the purpose of static methods and variables?
Ans : we do not need to create the object to access such variables. Therefore, static is used in the case, where we need to define variables or methods which are common to all the objects of the class.

For example, In the class simulating the collection of the students in a college, the name of the college is the common attribute to all the students. Therefore, the college name will be defined as static.
